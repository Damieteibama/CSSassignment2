              My name is Damiete Ibama. A graduate of Petro-Chemical
              Engineering.My love for Technology started since i was a child, I
              fascinated with gadgets and how they work. I loved to build things
              and repairs stuffs. That shaped my choice of sciences in high
              school and also to study engineering in the University. Currently
              enrolled into the Stutern Graduate Accelerator Programme to become
              a skilled Mobile developer(Softwaredeverloper) and do what i love
              most, create solutions to problems with just writting codes.
              Technology has the ability to impact lives at a level and scale
              that has never been realized in the history of mankind. The idea
              that something I create can impact someone across the world now,
              or in the future is what drives my passion for Technology.

                Learning at Stutern has been very impactful and educative , so
                far I have leart about HTML and CSS which are the building
                blocks of a web page. HTML give the structure to the web page ,
                using its elements , tags and attributes while CSS helps you
                style the colour , font , borders , margin , positioning and so
                much more. I have also learnt about Git and GitHub - creating a
                repository, forking, cloning, collaboration and basic git commands.</i

                The difference betweeen padding , margin and borders includes;
              Padding is the inner space between the content and the border of
              your box. Border is the perimeter of the box. Borders can be
              invisible or not Margin is the outer space (or lack of space)
              surrounding the box.
